Liboro is intended to be used by Taupemist members to define, test and experiment various smart contract designs and concepts using TDD principles.

Eventually, this may become a node api to allow applications to interface with smart contracts on the EOS blockchain.
We may use this as a monorepository where each contract would be stored in packages to allow for easy customisation and plug-and-play abilities.
